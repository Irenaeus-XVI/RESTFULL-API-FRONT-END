# RESTful API Front-End

This repository contains the front-end code for a RESTful API. It is designed to work in conjunction with the [RESTful API Back-End](https://github.com/Irenaeus-XVI/RESTFULL-API-Back-End) repository, which provides the necessary API endpoints.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for interacting with the RESTful API
- Displaying and manipulating data fetched from the API
- Seamless integration with the back-end server

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end code.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) framework for responsive and mobile-first design.
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) for the client server.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone `https://github.com/Irenaeus-XVI/RESTFULL-API-FRONT-END.git`
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the client server:

    ```
    node js/index.js 
    ```
    
## Usage

1.Interact with the API:

    Use the provided user interface to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through the RESTful API endpoints provided by the back-end server.

2.View and manipulate data:

    The front-end code will display the fetched data from the back-end API and allow you to perform various actions on it.

## Backend Documentation

For detailed information about the backend implementation and setup, please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/Irenaeus-XVI/RESTFULL-API-Back-End) file of the RESTful API Back-End repository. It provides instructions on how to configure and run the backend server.

Make sure to follow the instructions in the backend README.md before starting the front-end application to ensure the proper functioning of the RESTful API.
